            <p>
            We live in an era characterised by constant change. The past few years technological and scientific innovations have altered our lives and societies. 
            In this changing world, people develop feelings of insecurity and mistrust of the scientific community. Sharing science on social media means dealing 
            with naysayers, but it also provides the opportunity to engage such people in thoughtful and productive science discussion. We believe it is crucial 
            that people have faith in science, combined with critical thinking. The only key towards this is <span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">knowledge</span>. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">Our aim</span> this year was to bring people closer to science through Synthetic Biology and the iGEM Competition. Keeping in mind that science relies on the 
            public as much as the public relies on science, we really put great effort into participating in and organising as many science communication events as 
            possible. We had the pleasure to meet and discuss with plenty of people with whom we share our enthusiasm for the fascinating world of Biology!
            <br><br>
            Through this process, we also gained knowledge as a team and individuals. The most important thing we understood is that science communication is a 
            conversation and not a monologue.

        <br>
        <p>
            Towards this goal, it was a great pleasure to attend the NGOs’ Fair organised by BEST (Board of European Students of Technology) Athens, ESN (Erasmus 
            Student Network) of the National Technical University of Athens and Mindspace. The event happened on the 1st and 2nd of March 2022. The first day, all 
            the voluntary teams were presented briefly in an online environment. On the second day, we got to meet the participants during the live event at the 
            deanery’s building of the National Technical University of Athens. Taking into account that the majority of NTUA students aren’t aware of the student 
            associations, partners and services of their University, NGOs’ Fair gave them the opportunity to get to know the teams and the organisations that are 
            active at their Student Institution. There, our team had its own stand to inform the young Technical students about our action in the field of Synthetic 
            Biology and the tasks of an Engineer in an iGEM group.

                        acquisition of sterile scientific knowledge, but also aims to broaden one’s mind and to cultivate multiple skills. One of the most outstanding 
                        ways to achieve this, is- without doubt- the participation in a student team and the follow up to its extracurricular activities.

          <br>
        <p>
            UNIque Days was an event organised at the deanery’ s building of the National Technical University of Athens by UNIque Minds. Its main purpose was to bridge 
            the gap between secondary school and tertiary education, by providing high school students with vocational guidance, by informing them of their academic 
            options and by advising them to find out what they want to study. The event was particularly focused on giving those students information  about studying at 
            the different departments of NTUA, as well as about the extracurricular activities and teams they can join.  Participating in UNIque days on May 7th 2022 
            gave us the chance to talk to young students and inspire them to follow their dreams.

                        emphasise the fact that university life  is not just synonymous to attending classes and labs, but also  to widen one’s mind by taking part in 
                        different sorts of groups and activities. In the end, we presented our project briefly, in order to hear their opinion and their questions.

      <p>
        Another event we attended was Biochem day, powered by Chemecon. Chemecon is the first voluntary, non-profit Association of Young Chemical Engineers in Greece 
        and is active at the National Technical University of Athens. It is an association with dynamic potential that wishes to contribute substantially to the 
        connection of students with the subject of their studies. It constantly strives to identify and address the barriers that stand between Chemical Engineering 
        students and their profession, bridging any possible gap. The goal of Biochem Day was to inform students and achieve the networking between companies and 
        academia. The thematic axis of the conference is biotechnology, focusing on biotechnological products and the utilisation of biotechnology in industrial 
        processes. 
        <br><br>
        As a synthetic biology group, it was our pleasure to talk to students and not only about the field of biotechnology. During the conference, we communicated 
        the importance of the field of synthetic biology in industry and how through it an innovative approach to the production of biotechnological products can be 
        achieved. In addition, we discussed with experts, researchers and students about problems to which synthetic biology can provide solutions such as for example 
        the development of new production methods, methods of increasing the efficiency of already existing processes in the production process, etc.
        <br><br>
        Finally, having our own bench in the “research corner” we were able to communicate our project and how the system we designed is connected to biotechnology. 
        Our biosensor was well received by the students who participated in the event, and we hope to have introduced new perspectives to the way synthetic biology is 
        approached by them.

        <p>
        Social media constitutes a fun and massive way to inform the public on scientific issues. Besides, in recent years this form of communication is gaining more 
        and more popularity among all ages, so through them, we could spread awareness to a broad audience quickly and effectively. We were very surprised by the 
        participation and the feedback we received - not only from students but also from the general public!

        <span style="color: #e9e9e9; font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold'; font-size: 30px;">Fun fact series</span>
        <br><br>
        We created a Fun fact series on Instagram and Facebook. Every week we posted from our accounts a story, containing a scientific fact that we found interesting 
        or funny, with some additional information. We made sure to put the scientific facts forward in a simple and understandable way, with a view to them being 
        conceived from everyone.

        <br>
        <p>
        Every year, TEDxAthens creates unique gatherings and events designed to catalyse and stimulate creativity, entrepreneurship, social change and inclusion. 
        TEDxAthens is a proud member of TED’s independently organised TEDx events program, and the first ever TEDx event in Greece, established in May 2009. It 
        amplifies great ideas worth sharing and implementing to the world. To date, it has curated more than 200 talks from world-renowned thinkers, doers and 
        innovators. These talks have been viewed more than 7 million times online. It is, by acclamation, the most impactful and influential platform for ideas in 
        Greece and the wider Balkans region.TEDxAthens is a team of 70+ passionate volunteers, who believe in creating opportunities for change, by delivering 
        high-quality content born from all aspects of life, through conferences, adventures and social projects, in order to educate, motivate, inspire and become 
        catalysts of change both locally and internationally.
        <br><br>
        Taking into account the above data, our team couldn’t miss the chance to reach out to such a wide audience, so we were really thrilled when we got accepted to 
        present an interactive workshop. 
        <br><br>
        The event took place on May 28th at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center and it was where we put our workshop into action. We chose to demonstrate 
        “DNA extraction from a banana”, considering that DNA extraction constitutes the most common technique, used in Biological laboratories almost every day. Before 
        the practical part, we made a brief introduction about the molecule of DNA, its properties and some relevant fun facts, in order to warm up our audience about 
        what was about to follow. Then, each participant has on his disposal his own kit to execute the experiment. The demonstration of the process, as well as the 
        provide of help were our two principal roles. In the meanwhile, we were glad to explain the order and the significance of each step for the final result. We 
        did our best with a view to catching people’s attention on the experimental experience and to simplifying complicated terms and lab processes.

        <h1><span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">28th Scientific Congress of Hellenic Medical Students</span></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        The “Scientific Congress of Hellenic Medical Students” is an annual event which attracts more than 2000 students and 500 professors from all parts of 
        Greece, as well as from abroad. It represents the vision of hellenic students to actively advance their learning and to cultivate and promote scientific 
        and social values. The “Scientific Society of Hellenic Medical Students”, which organises this event, is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation of 
        medical students with 7 Chapters, one in every Hellenic Medical School. This year the “Scientific Society of Hellenic Medical Students” (SSHMS) held the 
        28th “Scientific Congress of Hellenic Medical Students” (SCHMS) and the 16th “International Forum for Medical Students and Junior Doctors” which took place 
        in Athens, Greece, from 13th-15th of May 2022, as well as virtually, thus adopting a hybrid format.
        <br><br>
        One of the sessions of this year’s Congress was dedicated to the Greek iGEM teams. It was programmed for the Saturday 14th of May 2022 and consisted of six 
        iGEM teams’ presentations of 15 minutes each. At this part of the event, two members of our team displayed the main idea of our project and received questions 
        and useful feedback. Apart from this, we attended the other teams’ project presentations, and we were inspired by what we learned about the initiatives for 
        the iGEM competition from other local teams. 
        <br><br>
        On May 15th the conference hosted our workshop on Genome Editing Design with CRISPR-Cas9 on Benchling Platform. The workshop included general information 
        about the CRISPR-Cas9 system and bioinformatics evaluation guided RNAs (gRNAs), in order to effectively silence the ADE2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One 
        of our main intentions was to present the CRISPR-Cas9 technique interactively, that’s why we set our presentations as an in silico experiment.  In the 
        meanwhile, we helped the participants while working on the Benchling platform  and afterwards we had a conversation on the CRISPR-Cas9 system and its 
        applications.

        <br>
        <p>
        Shortly before the closing date for the submission of the “Project Biosafety Form”, our team organised a debate on the topic of Biosafety open to the public. 
        On June 17th our debate-event was hosted in the Lecture amphitheatre in the Medical School’s Library in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
        <br><br>
        We invited a Greek YouTube debate channel called “The debate podcast” to collaborate with our team on the event. Our duet joined forces to realise an 
        educational event that aimed to raise awareness of the students, and future scientists on a vastly crucial matter that not only concerns the scientific 
        community, but also the entire modern society.  Furthermore, we invited rhetoric university clubs to present their action. The event was tailored to students 
        from different fields, who were keen on contemporary biological issues. The main category of students who attended the event was Medical and Biology students, 
        so we targeted students who will be working in actual labs in the near future.  
        <br><br>
        After introducing the teams, we underlined Biosafety rules and levels, as well as genetically engineered organisms’ social impact. We put great effort in 
        highlighting that the use of biosafety practices and principles to reduce the health-related risks associated with handling infectious agents, toxins and other 
        biological hazards is more than important in a laboratory setting. Beside that, we explained how Biosafety levels (BSL) are used to identify the protective 
        measures needed in every lab to protect workers, the environment, and the public.   
        <br><br>
        It was then when we discussed the safety measures in projects from the past. In this part  the interaction with our audience started. We were content enough 
        to receive their thoughts and arguments on the subject.   
        <br><br>
        In the framework of Integrated Human Practices, we presented our project to the audience and received feedback about the measures we need to take to ensure 
        that our team complies with all the Biosafety rules. Except that, we were feeling curious to observe how unspecialised Biocomputing people perceive our project’s notion.    
        <br><br>
        The night ended with a very interesting debate among three students on the theme: Is it safe to release genetically engineered microorganisms in nature? 
        It was a great pleasure for us to have invited three remarkable and skilful speakers, who defended different points of views on the hot-table topic of GMOs.

        <p>
        In September, the online Greek Student Journal “Foititikos Cosmos” (=Students’ world) hosted an article of ours in its online page. “Foititikos Cosmos'’ is an independent and cooperative initiative, created in 2018 by a  few 18 years-old students. Today, after 4 years of operation and expansion, the page is regarded by hundreds of readers per day, especially students. The journal’s administratives and the editors opened up the chance to present the rapidly developing field of Synthetic Biology, highlighting how “Synbio” actively makes the world a better place and introduces the iGEM competition, our team and its connection with the Greek universities. For us, it was another opportunity to draw attention to the potentials of “Symbio”, its limitless applications and the gravity to support innovative efforts from ambitious young scientists.

        <h1><span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">Visiting Anavryta Experimental Lyceum</span></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        On September 22 we visited Anavryta Experimental Lyceum, which was the school of one of our team members. During our visit we did an experimental workshop for 26 senior high school students that aim to continue with life sciences studies. Our workshop had three parts. First, we did a small presentation to introduce synthetic biology, the iGEM competition, past iGEM projects that really drew our attention when we first encountered the competition, our project and some basics about the CRISPR/Cas9 System and its applications. Since the school had a laboratory equipped to perform basic biology experiments, we decided for the students to perform in teams two experiments. The first one was transformation, which is a big part of the syllabus for the third grade of high school. We explained all the steps and then assisted the students to perform the experiment with the appropriate safety measures (Ethanol, Gloves, Chlorine Water). Students and their teachers were really thrilled to perform a real experiment of what is presented to them in books.   
        <br><br>
        The second experimental procedure that we used was protein expression using a cell free system. This was a donation kit by minipcr BioBits®: Protein Structure and Function. Students learned how a cell free system works, how proteins with different sequence may have similar function, how a single mutation can affect the protein structure and what fluorescent proteins are. During the experiment, students had PCR tubes with cell lysate   (cell free system) and the DNA sequence coding for three different versions of a fluorescent protein FP1,FP2,FP3 and water as the control. The goal of the lab was to find which protein is fluorescent under blue light, which is safer than UV radiation, which is used for the Green Fluorescent Protein (FP1). After adding the DNA to each tube, students had the opportunity to observe the result after  24 hours of the experiment our team had already performed the previous day. We hope that this workshop raised awareness regarding synthetic biology and enthusiasm in the field of biology. Special thanks to the teachers  Ms. Stamatia Tzanopoulou and Mr. Anastasios Botsakos for giving us this opportunity.

        <h1><span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">Biological Fairy Tale</span></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        Aiming to reach out to even younger target groups, we decide to edit an illustrated fairy tail for children between 3-7 years old. For this reason, we created an open-access online book, available for teachers and parents in two languages, both English and Greek. We sent our fairy tail to kindergarten’s teachers, and we were delighted to find out that it has been appealing for a large portion of kids. The plot is based on the way a cell functions, because its main pursuit is to introduce to little kids the magnificent world of cellular Biology. We attempted to underline the significance of coordination and cooperation not only in the frame of a cell, but also in real life. On top of everything else, we indicated in a playful and super simplified  way the role and the location of DNA in the cell’s nucleus. Last but not least, we did our best to design representative, but at the same time interactive and fun, graphic illustrations.
