                <div class="collapsible-text">
                <p>In June 2022 we took part in the exciting design collaboration by Queen’s University, McGill University, and Cornell University iGEM teams. Wanting to create an educational book to educate the public, these three teams invited us to send them a form filled with information about our favourite bacterial species. We chose the bacterium <i>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</i>, also known as The "Vampire Bacterium". <i>Bdellovibrio</i> is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacteria. One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers.* Our choice was based on our intention to show to the public that in nature there are several organisms with completely different ways of living, metabolizing and reproducing. As the young representatives of the scientific community, we believe it is important to make clear that every form of life is far more complicated naturally than it is in theory.

                <p>In June 2022, team iGEM Patras Med reached out to us and invited us to take part in a collaboration aiming to create a video called “iJET”. The collaboration was organized by two teams, Patras Med and Aachen. We were asked to film a short video explaining our project that was going to be a part of a bigger video that the two teams were about to create by combining all the videos they had received. We happily wrote a script and filmed the video in a park. Furthermore, we spoke about why we were taking part in the iGEM competitions and why we like it, in which track we were competing this year. Finally, we gave a brief explanation of the project, where we are aiming and what innovative solution we give to an existing project by using synthetic biology tools. Hope you enjoy the “iJET” video here.</p>

                <label for="noise">Exploring Biological Noise</label>
                <div class="collapsible-text">
                    <p>Noise, in electronics, is an unwanted disturbance in an electrical signal. On the other hand, in information theory, noise is considered to be the opposite of information. But what about noise and stochasticity in biological systems? 
                        <br><br>
                        Noise permeates biology on all levels, from the most basic molecular, sub-cellular processes to the dynamics of tissues, organs, organisms, and populations.  Due to biological noise, it is mostly impossible to determine with absolute certainty how a system will evolve from a specific initial state. The stochastic fluctuations in the level of cellular components can be caused by multiple factors. They can roughly be divided into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic noise refers to the stochastic fluctuations within the system under consideration, usually caused by the inherently probabilistic nature of the underlying biochemical reactions. The stochastic processes outside the system under consideration may serve a source of extrinsic noise.
                        <br><br>
                        At first, synthetic biologists considered stochastic gene expression an important obstacle to overcome. Nowadays, it has arguably become one of the main insights contributed by the discipline, since it reconstructs our comprehension of why, how and when specific genes are expressed. Within synthetic biology research, the use of the term noise often refers to stochastic fluctuations which can potentially have a functional status. For example, with synthetic biology pursuing the re-organisation and control of biological components to make functional devices, biological noise can be a source of inspiration and a field of observation for scientists in order to design new systems that exhibit the desired properties. Another way to approach biological stochasticity as a functional tool, is by considering it as an accelerator of the pace of evolution. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, despite the positive effect of biological noise in the field of synthetic biology, there are cases where the systems being designed must be very precise. One such example is the system our team has designed this year. The decision-making in the system we propose in our project is based on multi-prismatic stimuli which have different weight and importance for the final result. With our system based on data collection and evaluation biological noise can lead to false results and be a problem for making the final decision.
                        <br><br>
                        This is why our team during the Aegean Meeting, organised by iGEM Patras, gathered many Greek iGEMers and organised the following collaboration. Wanting to observe noise in biological systems and in which cases it can be a problem, we organised the following game. Twenty iGEMers were placed in specific positions to form a square and each of them was given three circular cards of different color, one red, one green and one blue. Each time a member of our team told the participants a specific word and then they had to pick up the card with the color they thought matched the word they had heard and place it above their head. Their decision shouldn’t have been influenced by what color the other participants had picked. We took a photo of how the square was shaped in color for each word that was heard. The technique we followed was simple. At the beginning we told the participants apparently 'simple' words that clearly express one of the three colors. For example, the word 'fire' would obviously be represented by the color red for most participants. But then we moved on to much more complex words, much more abstract, where the choice of color is purely subjective and is not influenced by the physical properties of the idea or the object. The result for each word is shown below.
                        <br><br>
                        Having now received the photos in our hands we were ready to do a little statistical analysis of the results and draw our conclusions about the noise. The following chart summarizes our findings.  
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4294/wiki/collaborations/noise/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-15-35-42-noise-our-collab-noise-our-collab-pdf.png" width="100%">
                        <br><br>
                        The square formed by the participants during our collaboration represents a biological system, by observing the choice of the chosen color for each word we are able to judge how an individual member would react in relation to the decision that the entire biological system finally made. As expected in the first words the participants heard the final decision was clear, the word fire brings to mind the color red, the word sky blue and the word forest green. The three words that showed 100% agreement between participants were the word fire, the word forest, and the words sky and dream. However, as we progress to much more complex concepts such as the word success or the word teamwork, the biological noise increases and now each participant can have a different opinion than what the biological system as a whole finally chooses. The most biological noise was presented in the words success and party on the island where the change of the decision of two participants would have a great influence on the final result. 
                        <br><br>
                        The conclusions we draw from this action have a big impact on how we approach our system. It is also an explanation of the reason why the biosensor we designed consists of multiple populations. So, as our system aims to recognize and analyse multifaceted stimuli and combine information, the final decision must come from many populations and be the result of the majority of the decision of the individual populations. Ιf we had designed a biosensor that consisted of only one population, it might be effective in detecting simple stimuli and recognizing small patterns, but it could not be reliable for making decisions based on complex stimuli, each of which has to have a different weight for the final decision. In conclusion, the proposed system consists of many subpopulations of bacteria and thus can overcome metabolic barriers and make better decisions since it is based on majority-based choices.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, we would like to thank iGEM Patras because our collaboration took place during the Aegean Meeting they organised. Also, we would like to thank the teams that participated: Patras, Crete, Thessaloniki and Thessaly, (Upi Patras?) for their excellent cooperation and the will to explore biological noise with us!

                        An educational process that arose during the first few months of our journey in the competition was the one with the team Thessaloniki. We reached out to them to organize a virtual game on Instagram based on a very popular board game. Every week one of the teams would post a mystery story related to synthetic biology, leaving the followers with a huge question. The members of this team accepted and answered questions from the public for 24 hours. After a day, the other team would reveal the end of the mystery story, finally answering the big question that had been posed to the audience. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our collaboration aimed to increase public engagement with small questions about synthetic biology. Our followers had the opportunity to be concerned about "problems" that occurred in every iGEM team on a daily basis, as some of our mystery stories were indeed true. Troubleshooting is a big part of the iGEM competition, by creating those “SynBio Stories” we gave the participants a good picture of what paths our thinking should follow every day in the lab when problems arise or things don't go exactly as planned. We were happy to receive so many questions and possible solutions from synthetic biology fans. Some of them were very close to the real solution of the problems we were presenting each time.
