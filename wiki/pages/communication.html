            <br>
            <p> We live in an era characterised by constant change. The past few years technological and scientific innovations have altered our lives and societies. 
                In this changing world, people develop feelings of insecurity and mistrust of the scientific community. Sharing science on social media means dealing 
                with naysayers, but it also provides the opportunity to engage such people in thoughtful and productive science discussion. We believe it is crucial 
                that people have faith in science, combined with critical thinking. The only key towards this is <span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">knowledge</span>. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-family: 'Glacial Indifference Bold';">Our aim</span> this year was to bring people closer to science through Synthetic Biology and the iGEM Competition. Keeping in mind that science relies on the 
            public as much as the public relies on science, we really put great effort into participating in and organising as many science communication events as 
            possible. We had the pleasure to meet and discuss with plenty of people with whom we share our enthusiasm for the fascinating world of Biology!
            <br><br>
            Through this process, we also gained knowledge as a team and individuals. The most important thing we understood is that science communication is a 
            conversation and not a monologue.

        <h1><b>Communicating iGEM, Synthetic Biology and our team</b></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1><b>NGO's Fair</b></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Towards this goal, it was a great pleasure to attend the NGOs’ Fair organised by BEST (Board of European Students of Technology) Athens, ESN (Erasmus 
            Student Network) of the National Technical University of Athens and Mindspace. The event happened on the 1st and 2nd of March 2022. The first day, all 
            the voluntary teams were presented briefly in an online environment. On the second day, we got to meet the participants during the live event at the 
            deanery’s building of the National Technical University of Athens. Taking into account that the majority of NTUA students aren’t aware of the student 
            associations, partners and services of their University, NGOs’ Fair gave them the opportunity to get to know the teams and the organisations that are 
            active at their Student Institution. There, our team had its own stand to inform the young Technical students about our action in the field of Synthetic 
            Biology and the tasks of an Engineer in an iGEM group.

                        within an actual scientific team, as well as to transmit to those young people the message that higher education is not only related to the 
                        acquisition of sterile scientific knowledge, but also aims to broaden one’s mind and to cultivate multiple skills. One of the most outstanding 
                        ways to achieve this, is- without doubt- the participation in a student team and the follow up to its extracurricular activities.

            <p>
            We attended the Safety Seminar delivered by Dr Thanos Kakkanas at the Hellenic Pasteur Institute as well. The seminar focused on the potential dangers 
            when working in the laboratory, such as carcinogens, mutagens, highly flammable chemicals, acids and corrosive chemicals, cytotoxic reagents, neurotoxic 
            chemicals, respiratory, skin and eye irritants, inflammatory reagents etc. Another part of the workshop concerned disinfection and sterilisation. We were 
            finally informed about the health problems provoked by constant standing and bad posture when working on the bench. 
            </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>General Laboratory Safety Rules</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Our experiments were conducted at Professor A. Agathagelidis’ laboratory at the Biology Department of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens, 
        which is a BSL 1 standard laboratory.  The organisms we were using are the following E. coli strains: DH5-alpha, DH5-alpha-Z1, DH10-beta, BL21. Some of 
        our experiments were also hosted at other laboratories of the Biology department that provided us with the special equipment  we needed (for example Dr. 
        Dedos laboratory provided us with the plate reader). All of these laboratories are BSL1 standard laboratories. 
            <br><br>
            For that reason, we aimed to follow all the laws and regulations of laboratory operations according to the European Union, the Greek Government, and the 
            host institution for our experiments (NKUA). You can read more about those laws and regulations below:

            <p>   
            <br><br>
            All team members followed strictly and responsibly the dress code, which includes closed shoes, full-length trousers, and mandatory use of a lab coat, 
            mask and nitrile gloves, not only when doing experiments, but also when spectating. 
            We made sure that no food or drinks were exposed in the laboratory spaces by keeping them in a separate freezer in another room.
            We were also very cautious with our waste management; we never discarded any living organisms or chemicals. Our used Petri dishes were all autoclaved 
            before discarding, and all liquid cultures and consumables that were exposed to the microorganisms, such as tips and eppendorfs, were incubated overnight 
            with a strong chlorine/soap solution, before disposal. When working with dangerous substances, such as ethidium bromide, we always worked on a separate 
            special bench and used another pair of gloves.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p> 
            Warning signs and safety instructions were hung on our walls.
            Our laboratory was provided with a fire safety corner.
            Moreover, there was never one person working in the laboratory alone, in case an emergency happened and they needed help.    
            <br><br>
            As the organism we used was E.coli disinfection played a very important role while conducting our experiments. An aseptic technique was always used and 
            our microbiological work was done under flame. All the workstations were sterilised with 70% ethanol both prior to and after each experiment.

          <br><br>
          <h1><b>UNIque Days</b></h1>
          <br>
          <p> One of the goals of our team is the contribution of an RBS part collection. 
            <br><br>
            <h2>Kill switch</h2> 
            <br>
            Our project is foundational and it will not have direct applications, although there are several fields where “PERspectives” could apply in the distant 
            future.  However, as an outcome of our Integrated human practices work, we propose the design of a kill switch, which ensures that the two bacterial 
            populations of our system, the Senders and the Receivers, will cogrow and that the population of the one will not exceed the population of the other. 
            <br><br>
            After investigating what previous teams did concerning the control of two cell populations we  found very inspiring the project “Ecolibrium'' from iGEM 
            Imperial 2016 team. Their team accomplished the goal we desired for our kill switch. They created a quorum sensing based system, that does not allow one 
            population to grow more than the other. 
            <br><br>
            We decided to use some of the parts they contributed (BBa_K1893000 and BBa_K1893002) and integrate the genes we desire under the control of the quorum 
            sensing promoters of the above parts. That way, we theoretically created a different version of their existing system. 
            <br><br>
            <img class="senders_receivers" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4294/wiki/safety/senders-receivers.png">
            More specifically, instead of the STAR and anti-STAR genes, we thought we could insert the genes of a toxin (SymE) and its antitoxin (SymR). 
            <br><br>            
            At both populations, LasR and RhlR, two transcriptional activators,  are constitutively produced. The Senders produce C4 AHL quorum sensing molecule, 
            which is necessary for the activation of the Rhi promoter that controls the expression of the toxin. 
            The Receivers produce  3O-C12 AHL constitutively, which is necessary for the activation of the Las promoter that controls the production of the antitoxin. 
            So, when the Senders are separated from the Receivers, only the toxin is produced and they do not survive. But when their population is equal to the 
            Receivers’ population both C4 and O-C12 exist at the same level.  The system works vice versa at the Receivers. 
            <br><br>
            Since we did not have much time to test the kill switch system in the laboratory, its implementation is one of the future goals of our project. 
            We hope that other iGEM teams will find it useful and will be able to integrate it in their projects.

          <p>Our team this year organised and participated in various educational and communicational events. But we never forgot that our duty towards our audience was, 
             except from helping them explore the world of Synthetic Biology, to make sure that this procedure is safe for them. Our team followed all the rules concerning 
             biological safety (we ensured that everyone was wearing gloves and protective masks during our workshops,we did not use dangerous substances, we gave them 
             specific instructions and supervised in case anyone needed assistance etc), but also personal data safety.  Φωτογραφία απο βραδιά ερευνητή

            <br>
            As a team, we strongly believe that personal information is of foremost importance. For this reason, we have planned to obtain the necessary permits in the 
            context of our actions:

            <ul>
                <li>We asked for permission for all of the photos and videos taken by our team for our Science communication actions and for our Integrated human practices actions.</li>

          <h1>Public Awareness</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h2>Debate on biosafety issues</h2>
            <br>
            <img class="debate_img" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4294/wiki/safety/public-awareness.jpg">
            Shortly before the closing date for the submission of the “Project Biosafety Form”, our team organised a debate on the topic of Biosafety open to the 
            public. 
            <br><br>
            We invited a Greek youtube debate channel called “The debate podcast” to collaborate with our team on the event. We also invited rhetoric university clubs 
            to present their work. The event was addressed to students from different fields. 
            <br><br>
            After introducing the teams, our team presented Biosafety rules and levels, explained what a genetically engineered organism is and the ways we can modify 
            genomes.  Also, we focused on the applications of those organisms and the social impact that they can have. We unravelled some ways we can prevent future 
            destructions, such as kill switches. Then we discussed with our audience some safety measures in projects from the past. The night ended with a fascinating 
            debate among three students on the theme: Is it safe to release genetically engineered microorganisms in nature? 
            <br><br>
            Since we wanted to learn more about what people know and think about biosafety, we asked the participants to fill out a questionnaire about genetically 
            engineered organisms and laboratory safety rules. Some of the results of that research are presented in the graphs below:
            <br><br>
            How much do you think genetically modified organisms affect our lives? (1: not at all-5: very much)

            <img class="what_img" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4294/wiki/safety/biosafey-what.png">
            What do you think biosafety is about?
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>8.3% : laboratory safety rules</li>
                <li>25%:  the release of genetically modified organisms in nature</li>
                <li>58.3% : all the above</li>
                <li>8.1%: other</li>
            </ul>
            <br>          
            Do you think genetically modified organisms should be released in nature? 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>33.3%: No</li>
                <li>25%: Yes</li>
                <li>41.7%: It depends from different factors, such as the organism.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            We also asked them to name some of the genetically engineered organisms they know and we observed that the most popular answers were corn, soy and bacteria 
            that produce insulin.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Biosafety video collaboration</h2> 
            <br>
            We participated in a series of informative videos based on Biosafety Practices organised by Team IISER Mohali from India. This initiative aims to inform the 
            general public about the measures carried out in the laboratories and reduce scepticism regarding Genetic Engineering and Synthetic Biology.
            Our team demonstrated some of the Biosafety measures followed in our laboratory. It was a very fun and creative procedure! You can find our video here.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Various HP actions</h2>
            <br>
            We would like to note that we informed people about biosafety issues at most of our other Human Practices events. For example, when we visited the Anavrita 
            High School we briefly explained to the children some kill switch systems.
