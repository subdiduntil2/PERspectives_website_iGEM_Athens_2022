    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
    <p>
        In recent years, both the universal and our local community are confronted with multiple pre-existing, but also new issues:  from environmental 
        pollution to inadequate therapeutic methods for plaguing diseases and insufficient food production for 7,98 billion people. During our 
        brainstorming period, the ideas were numerous and the problems we wanted to solve uncountable. So many different questions were waiting for an 
        answer, and for months we couldn’t make up our minds which one was worth more our attention. After creating a final list of our top ideas, we 
        agreed that it was the right moment to reach out to different scientists, experts and international references. In this context, human practices 
        were a crucial part of our project, through which we aimed to ascertain which concept was more up to date and how a realistic solution would offer 
        genuine help to humanity. Following these interactions, our team finally resolved that nothing would be more critical to us than devoting 
        ourselves to a project which could constitute an adjustable solution in many different fields.
        <br><br>
        Finding out that Biocomputing has emerged as an extremely contemporary and rapidly developing science, we were persuaded that our inspiration 
        should be derived from it. Influenced by the fascinating universe of Computer science, our goal is to implement a “Perceptron” algorithm in a 
        biological system. The “Perceptron” is the fundamental algorithm of a neural network, and its integration in a biological circuit could provide 
        an alternative and novel point of view in synthetic biology systems’ design by introducing a foundational level of bacterial artificial 
        intelligence. Due to its intrinsic capability of cellular decision-making, our biocomputing circuit could have various biosensing applications in 
        medicine, the environment, industry, and limitless other fields. 
        <br><br>
        Our decision-making process was based on receiving information from the right people during the brainstorming months. Viewing our project through 
        their lens helped us delve deeper into the values we want to invest in and represent through “PERspectives”.

              <h1>Awareness & Sensitivity</h1>
              <br>
              <h2>Choosing the right moment</h2>
              <br>
              <p> Going through the era of Big Data, information management becomes more and more challenging. In front of a vast amount of information, how to choose the most significant one? How to define that one input is more important than another, and in terms of quantity how much is this difference? How does the weight of each input determine the final output? In which way the total inputs should be summed up in order to lead to the right output? Is there any threshold? What about the intermediate steps before the final decision? And, is one individual capable of going through this process all alone? 
              <br><br>
              Considering all these questions and after research and communication with plenty of experts, we concluded that a typical computational algorithm wouldn’t be adequate to deal with the enormous complexity of biological inputs and natural environments. On the other hand, “Perceptron” inspired cell and genetic networks are a promising alternative to the most common “logic gate” inspired approach.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h2>From a single cell to population scale</h2>
              <br>
              <p> Single cell engineering is limited by the necessary molecular complexity and the accompanying metabolic burden of synthetic circuits. Our Perceptron-like sensor was not engineered on the single cell level. This design would probably pose a metabolic burden to the host cell. So we decided to build our system on the population scale. In E. Coli consortia simple tasks were engineered into cells. From these simple tasks more complex computations emerged by exploiting the well characterised bacterial quorum sensing signals, AHLs.
              <br><br>
              Working on our project,  we explored and characterised the manipulation of the RBS (Ribosome Binding Sites) sequence to determine our Perceptron’s weights, characterise and adapt bacterial computations based on QS based on previous research and construct a whole system that will sense stochasticly and respond logically. Compartmentalising the circuit ensures more reliable computation by population-averaging the response.
              <br><br>
              The proposed workflow might guide future scientists to build systems that will be able to decide if an output is needed, judging on multiple environmental conditions. Multi-cellular sensors will open new horizons towards complex biocomputing tasks and applications.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h2>The philosophical aspect of the project</h2>
              <br>
              <p> The conceptual background of our project was based on the notion of “determinism”.  Determinism is the philosophical idea that every event or state of affairs, including every decision and action, is the inevitable and necessary consequence of antecedent states of affairs. Under this point of view, all the events and the decisions are determined completely by previously existing causes. In other words, in terms of determinism decision-making is not a result of completely free will. It’s almost undeniable that the main effect that affects choices is one’s situation, so the number and the form of received inputs for external and internal environment.
              <br><br>
              In nature, environmental systems are characterised by a source of randomness, also perceived and as biological noise. Biological noise refers to the substantial cell-to-cell variation that is observed in populations of genetically identical cells. So even between two identical cells with the same quality and amount of inputs, the output may differ. (παραπομπή στο κολάμπ με τον θόρυβο και την Πάτρα) 
              <br><br>
              Wanting to overcome this natural randomness by finding a way to ensure that certain inputs would lead to a standard output, we went for designing a biological circuit working as a computational algorithm. In this way, inputs will have specific weights according to their importance for the final output, and they will be summed up in order to the system receive the full image of the external environment. Environmental changes will be perceived and depending on their form or extent, they will affect the final decision respectively. Either way, sometimes an output may seriously  affect a next decision, in case of a therapeutic or preventive application of the circuit.
              <br>
              As stated by Richard Dawkins, a British evolutionary biologist and author, “people believe the only alternative to randomness is intelligent design”. We are these people, and so we believe.

          <h1>Our Journey shared with experts</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
          After having strengthened our theoretical background, we were inspired to be involved in the troubleshooting more personally. We then decided to engage with the people that motivated us the most to learn more about their experiences. The Integrated Human Practices Part, including the hilarious interaction with diverse researchers and scientists, exerted great influence on our workflow, idea, design, implementation and potential applications. Nothing would have been the same without the advice, the help and the knowledge feedback we got after these contacts. (Παραπομπή στα Integrated).

            <br>
            <p>

            <h2>Inclusivity</h2> 
            <br>
            Our project creates a system with no geographic boundaries. This means that it is able to solve problems globally, as it constitutes a minimal circuit solving complex problems. We aspire to make an in vivo decision making system, with applications not only on our local community, but also on a worldwide level. 
            <br><br>
            Beside that, we are convinced that inclusivity leads to innovation. Increasing the diversity of the scientists and the experts we approached, had the impact of expanding our pool of ideas, broadening perspectives, and incorporating new ways of thinking. Science depends on innovation. Paradigm shifts and revolutionary thinking do not happen within an environment of stagnation.
            <br><br>
            The same goes to the Science Communication and Education target groups. We jumped through hoops to include a variety of people of different ages and academic backgrounds. This has been our major ambition, in order to receive feedback and reflections on our project idea and implementation from heterogenous people.
            <br><br>
            It’s not exaggerating to say that without diverse opinions, our project’s creativity and progress would have remained stagnant and infertile. 
            <br><br>


            <h2>Versatility</h2> 
            <br>
            Our planet, and at the same time our local community, confront plenteous serious problems and plagues that emerge for an efficient solution. Being confused and indecisive about which one we should pick up to cope with it, we ended up thinking that the alternative of creating a multi-system would be the best idea. So we fixed our attention on developing a “tool” capable of turning easily from fields of endeavour. We consider that PERpectives represents an adaptable biosensor, with various applications in decent sectors.  Personalised medicine (biosensors processing and reacting to complex environments living therapeutics  autonomous drug delivery systems), water quality, productivity in a bioreactor, energy consumption for computational tasks, pollution sensor are only a few of the examples of its implementation.  All in all, besides our contribution to the field of biocomputing and the  introduction of  biocomputing to Greece for the first time, we aimed to design a universal tool, versatile enough to solve both local and global problems. 
            <br><br>
            
            <h2>Biosafety</h2> 
            <br>
            Since the very beginning of our work, getting along with biosafety rules has been a cornerstone for our project. We consider it crucial to follow safety seminars and training before starting lab work, with the purpose of being well-prepared to protect our physical and mental health while dealing with our experimental part, as well as prevent misfortune events that may occur. We took into serious consideration that biosafety isn’t only about protecting yourself, but also your colleagues and even the entire planet from potential biological hazards. We put great effort in improving the biosafety conditions in our working space by investing money and time in buying enough protective equipment (gloves, alcohol, disinfectants, camping gas for working under sterile environment) and handling properly our liquid (bottles with chlorine) and solid (meticulous use of UV incubator) waste. Doing our best to reduce the health-related risks associated with handling infectious agents, toxins and other biological hazards in a laboratory setting was not our only goal.
            <br><br>
            Except for biosafety in the lab level, we also focused on our project design safety by proposing an effective kill switch (παραπομπή στην σελίδα του safety wet lab).
            <br><br>
            Our biosafety portfolio would be incomplete if we hadn’t organised a relevant event to spread awareness about the topic to future young scientists and generally higher education students. This is why we hosted a biosafety debate to inform our audience about the definition and the significance of biosafety and then catch their attention with a debate on genetically engineered organisms (GMOs) and some other bioethical dilemmas. (παραπομπή στη σελίδα Science Education and communication> Debate)
            <br><br>

            <h2>Scientific Diversity</h2> 
            <br>
            Being aware that the field of bio-computing (and especially the incorporation of computational models in biological systems) is not represented in our country, we hope to make a meaningful contribution in our scientific community via the communications we have with multiple scientists from Greek Universities and Research Centres. The lack of Greek scientists who were focused on Biocomputing and Synthetic Biology didn’t discourage us. On the contrary, we were challenged to approach scientists and academic experts from different, but relative to our project fields to complete the missing pieces of our project’s “puzzle”. 
            <br><br>
            For the biological segment, we started reaching out to researcher Professors of Biology  (Dr.Dedos Scarlatos, Dr.Diallinas Georgios, Dr.Ourania Tsistsilonis, Dr.Efthimiopoulos Spyros, Dr.Xatzinikolaou Dimitrios), of Medicine (Dr. Giamarelos Evaggelos, Dr.Maria Gazouli) and of Pharmacy (Dr.Demetzos Konstantinos, Dr.Marakos Panagiotis, Dr.Pouli Nikolais, Dr.Stefanidou Maria, Dr.Athanaselis Sotirios, Dr.Dona Artemis) departments of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
            <br><br>
            At a subsequent time, they referred us to even more relevant scientists of Biological  Research Institutes/ Centres (Dr.Gournas Christos, Dr.Miriagou Vivi, Dr. Scretas Dimitrios) to receive valuable feedback on our project’s design, organism’s selection and potential changes and adaptations in the system. 
            <br><br>
            However, we didn’t communicate only with Biology experts, but also with scientists from the engineering and the computing field, particularly for the computational segment. 
            <br><br>
            Then, we extended towards the international Synthetic Biology community with our Integrated Human Practices meetings and interviews with a view to acquiring a more global image for our circuit. (click here με παραπομπή στα Integrated) 
            <br><br>
            Finally, yet importantly, we got in contact with old iGem Greece members with speciality on the theme with an eye toward testing our system’s limitations, defaults and weak points. 
            <br><br>
            The combination of the knowledge and advice of all these experts formed our final design and broadened our horizons as far as our bionsensor’s applications are concerned. After our experience, we witnessed that interdisciplinarity, as well as scientific diversity, help advance critical thinking and cognitive development.
