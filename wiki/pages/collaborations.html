                <div class="collapsible-text">
                    <p>Noise, in electronics, is an unwanted disturbance in an electrical signal. On the other hand, in information theory, noise is considered to be 
                        the opposite of information. But what about noise and stochasticity in biological systems? 
                        <br><br>
                        Noise permeates biology on all levels, from the most basic molecular, sub-cellular processes to the dynamics of tissues, organs, organisms, 
                        and populations.  Due to biological noise, it is mostly impossible to determine with absolute certainty how a system will evolve from a 
                        specific initial state. The stochastic fluctuations in the level of cellular components can be caused by multiple factors. They can roughly be 
                        divided into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic noise refers to the stochastic fluctuations within the system under 
                        consideration, usually caused by the inherently probabilistic nature of the underlying biochemical reactions. The stochastic processes outside 
                        the system under consideration may serve a source of extrinsic noise.
                        <br><br>
                        At first, synthetic biologists considered stochastic gene expression an important obstacle to overcome. Nowadays, it has arguably become one 
                        of the main insights contributed by the discipline, since it reconstructs our comprehension of why, how and when specific genes are expressed. 
                        Within synthetic biology research, the use of the term noise often refers to stochastic fluctuations which can potentially have a functional status. For example, with synthetic biology pursuing the re-organisation and control of biological components to make functional devices, biological noise can be a source of inspiration and a field of observation for scientists in order to design new systems that exhibit the desired properties. Another way to approach biological stochasticity as a functional tool, is by considering it as an accelerator of the pace of evolution. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, despite the positive effect of biological noise in the field of synthetic biology, there are cases where the systems being designed must be very precise. One such example is the system our team has designed this year. The decision-making in the system we propose in our project is based on multi-prismatic stimuli which have different weight and importance for the final result. With our system based on data collection and evaluation biological noise can lead to false results and be a problem for making the final decision.
                        <br><br>
                        This is why our team during the Aegean Meeting, organised by iGEM Patras, gathered many Greek iGEMers and organised the following collaboration. Wanting to observe noise in biological systems and in which cases it can be a problem, we organised the following game. Twenty iGEMers were placed in specific positions to form a square and each of them was given three circular cards of different color, one red, one green and one blue. Each time a member of our team told the participants a specific word and then they had to pick up the card with the color they thought matched the word they had heard and place it above their head. Their decision shouldn’t have been influenced by what color the other participants had picked. We took a photo of how the square was shaped in color for each word that was heard. The technique we followed was simple. At the beginning we told the participants apparently 'simple' words that clearly express one of the three colors. For example, the word 'fire' would obviously be represented by the color red for most participants. But then we moved on to much more complex words, much more abstract, where the choice of color is purely subjective and is not influenced by the physical properties of the idea or the object. The result for each word is shown below.
                        <br><br>
                        Having now received the photos in our hands we were ready to do a little statistical analysis of the results and draw our conclusions about the noise. The following chart summarizes our findings.  
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4294/wiki/collaborations/noise/screenshot-2022-10-02-at-15-35-42-noise-our-collab-noise-our-collab-pdf.png" width="100%">
                        <br><br>
                        The square formed by the participants during our collaboration represents a biological system, by observing the choice of the chosen color for each word we are able to judge how an individual member would react in relation to the decision that the entire biological system finally made. As expected in the first words the participants heard the final decision was clear, the word fire brings to mind the color red, the word sky blue and the word forest green. The three words that showed 100% agreement between participants were the word fire, the word forest, and the words sky and dream. However, as we progress to much more complex concepts such as the word success or the word teamwork, the biological noise increases and now each participant can have a different opinion than what the biological system as a whole finally chooses. The most biological noise was presented in the words success and party on the island where the change of the decision of two participants would have a great influence on the final result. 
                        <br><br>
                        The conclusions we draw from this action have a big impact on how we approach our system. It is also an explanation of the reason why the biosensor we designed consists of multiple populations. So, as our system aims to recognize and analyse multifaceted stimuli and combine information, the final decision must come from many populations and be the result of the majority of the decision of the individual populations. Ιf we had designed a biosensor that consisted of only one population, it might be effective in detecting simple stimuli and recognizing small patterns, but it could not be reliable for making decisions based on complex stimuli, each of which has to have a different weight for the final decision. In conclusion, the proposed system consists of many subpopulations of bacteria and thus can overcome metabolic barriers and make better decisions since it is based on majority-based choices.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, we would like to thank iGEM Patras because our collaboration took place during the Aegean Meeting they organised. Also, we would like to thank the teams that participated: Patras, Crete, Thessaloniki and Thessaly, (Upi Patras?) for their excellent cooperation and the will to explore biological noise with us!

                        An educational process that arose during the first few months of our journey in the competition was the one with the team Thessaloniki. 
                        We reached out to them to organize a virtual game on Instagram based on a very popular board game. Every week one of the teams would post a 
                        mystery story related to synthetic biology, leaving the followers with a huge question. The members of this team accepted and answered 
                        questions from the public for 24 hours. After a day, the other team would reveal the end of the mystery story, finally answering the big 
                        question that had been posed to the audience. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our collaboration aimed to increase public engagement with small questions about synthetic biology. Our followers had the opportunity to 
                        be concerned about "problems" that occurred in every iGEM team on a daily basis, as some of our mystery stories were indeed true. 
                        Troubleshooting is a big part of the iGEM competition, by creating those “SynBio Stories” we gave the participants a good picture of what 
                        paths our thinking should follow every day in the lab when problems arise or things don't go exactly as planned. We were happy to receive so 
                        many questions and possible solutions from synthetic biology fans. Some of them were very close to the real solution of the problems we were 
                        presenting each time.

                        One day in the lab we noticed that a plate was contaminated and maggots had grown on it. However, looking at them through the stereoscope, 
                        we noticed that they had grown into a beautiful shape that had a grace to it. Wanting to emphasize the spirit that mistakes are part of the 
                        process, and we can learn from them and become better, we decided to create a mini collage to emphasize that our mistakes, if they are harmless,
                         can be very beautiful.
                        <br><br>
                        We also thought that we are probably not the only group that has encountered these kinds of problems, and that many of our colleagues may have 
                        made "beautiful mistakes". So we decided to approach them for a collaboration. We asked them to send us photos of lab errors that had an 
                        aesthetically pleasing look. We are so happy that the teams iGEM Tec CEM, Estonia_TUIT and iGEM-RUM responded. We saw beautiful mistakes in 
                        every picture they sent us, from gels that were not running in a proper way to single dots growing on plates. We thank them for not being ashamed 
                        to show the world that mistakes are pretty and useful sometimes, and we hope they enjoy the collage as much as we do!

                        Through this initiative, we had the opportunity to review the field of biocomputing by exploring realted papers. In this article we describe in 
                        detail the genetic circuit design, the experimental procedure that we aimed to follow and the model design. Working on this paper thoroughly 
                        was an invaluable experience which helped us delve deeper into the design of our system and be as accurate as possible in the way we communicate our research within the synbio community.

                   This year we had the pleasure of being in close contact with members of the Technion-Israel team. Our communication was multi-level and both groups were 
                   equally helped. In addition, it was especially pleasant to organize meetings where we could talk and see that we were not alone against the difficulties 
                   we faced.

                   <br><br>
                   During our first communication, the dry lab members understood that when modeling their systems they would need to take similar approaches. 
                   So the idea to join our forces and knowledge and create a two-way consulting relationship began to become a reality. 
                   <br><br>
                   Initially team Technion, who needed a kinetic based on enzyme equations sent a very early draft of their model to us so that we could understand the main 
                   key axes they intended to analyze. Βased on knowledge we already had on enzymatic kinetics, we created a file with tips and scientific tools that could be 
                   useful to them during the development of their model. The proposals focus on areas such as:
                   <br><br>
                   On enzymatic kinetics we suggested using the COPASI software. COPASI is widely used in many research projects for: modeling biological, biochemical, 
                   and chemical systems, in the development of theory and computational methods,in the development of “wet” laboratory methods. This software allows the 
                   user to determine kinetic constants and production rates based on an experimental dataset. Also it gives the opportunity to predict how a system will 
                   evolve overtime based on kinetic constant the user has imported. Members of our team were already familiar with this kind of software and thought that 
                   is would be useful for team Technion to use it and reach us whether a problem came up.

                   We also suggested Matlab for running their kinetic ODEs. We provided them with useful tutorials on how to use Matlab and SimBiology.
                   <br><br>
                   On microorganisms growth we suggested using the Monod model. We provided them useful equations and diagrams in order to have a better understanding on 
                   the different faces of a growth curve. We also provided equations on Monod first and second order kinetics and we summarised a way to determine the 
                   kinetic constants based on experimental data. 
                   <br><br>
                   Both teams were dealing with diffusion. On this subject, team Technion was already aware of the Fick’s Diffusion Law and intended to use it just like 
                   us. So we discussed on possible difficulties that would come up in the process of modeling diffusion and were open in new ideas and suggestions.
                   <br><br>
                   Finally, we suggested using the COMSOL software if team Technion was interested in dealing with matter transfer phenomena. This would maybe be useful 
                   if they wanted to simulate mass transfer in, outside a cell or across membranes. 
                   <br><br>
                   On a follow-up meeting between the dry lab members of each team, we were so happy to hear that they actually implemented some of our suggestions.

                   <br><br>
                   As a result of our collaboration with the team Technion, the proposal to record a podcast episode came up. We were so happy to be part of the “Angel Roots” Podcast. In the episode our team guested we talked about the scientific part of the project as well as the financial part of the iGEM Competition.  We were so lucky because team Technion had adjusted this episode’s questions according to our project and the bioinformatic aspects of it. We answered questions related to the following axes:
                   <br><br>
                   <ul style="font-size: 25px;">
                       <li>Who are we and how did we found out about iGEM?</li>
                       <li>Our project’s goal and its applications.</li>
                       <li>What financial difficulties we faced during the fundraising process this year?</li>
                       <li>Finally, we were asked to give some advice to the future iGEMers about the iGEM competition in general but also in groups that are thinking of 
                           revolving around bioinformatics. So in this case we also suggested some useful software tools that we used as well.</li>

                   <p>In June 2022 we took part in the exciting design collaboration by Queen’s University, McGill University, and Cornell University iGEM teams. 
                       Wanting to create an educational book to educate the public, these three teams invited us to send them a form filled with information about our 
                       favourite bacterial species. We chose the bacterium <i>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</i>, also known as The "Vampire Bacterium". <i>Bdellovibrio</i> 
                       is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacteria. One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other 
                       Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers.* Our choice was based on our intention to show to the public that in nature there are several 
                       organisms with completely different ways of living, metabolizing and reproducing. As the young representatives of the scientific community, we 
                       believe it is important to make clear that every form of life is far more complicated naturally than it is in theory.

                   <p>In June 2022, team iGEM Patras Med reached out to us and invited us to take part in a collaboration aiming to create a video called “iJET”. 
                       The collaboration was organized by two teams, Patras Med and Aachen. We were asked to film a short video explaining our project that was going to 
                       be a part of a bigger video that the two teams were about to create by combining all the videos they had received. We happily wrote a script and 
                       filmed the video in a park. Furthermore, we spoke about why we were taking part in the iGEM competitions and why we like it, in which track we were 
                       competing this year. Finally, we gave a brief explanation of the project, where we are aiming and what innovative solution we give to an existing 
                       project by using synthetic biology tools. Hope you enjoy the “iJET” video
